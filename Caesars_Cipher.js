/*In Caesars Cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount. The most common version of that is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.
This function takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.*/
function rot13(str) {
  
  return str;

// Change the inputs below to test

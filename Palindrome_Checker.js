/*Returns true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
Strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" can be checked.
Strings with special symbols, such as "2A3*3a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A3*3#A2" can be checked.*/
